# üéì Student ID Card Generator (Python, PIL, QR, Barcode)

Auther: Sumit Kumar

This project generates **front and back student ID cards** with customizable details like student photo, logo, signature, QR code, and barcode.  
It demonstrates how to use Python imaging and barcode libraries to create structured graphics.

## üì¶ Installation

Make sure you have **Python 3.8+** installed. Then install dependencies:

```bash
pip install pillow qrcode python-barcode

```
run collegeid.py once dependecy is installed, output would be generated as ID_front and ID_back file.


Special Instructions:
Photo size would look better with size in multiple of 160*200.
